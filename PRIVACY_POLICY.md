## Audio Focus Controller: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Audio Focus Controller demo app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Wrichik Basu. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available
on Google Play.

The app has been developed to demonstrate how to use the accompanying AudioFocusController library,
and also helps you to test your app.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

To my knowledge, I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like themes, etc.)) created/modified by you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. None of this
data is transferred to any server.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy,
please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Wrichik Basu.
Kolkata, India.
