You will have to manage Audio Focus in your Android app if you want to play any type of sound. Be it an alarm tone, music or a voice call, you will have to first ask for focus from the system, and play the tone if and only if the system grants you focus. With the help of this library, you can reduce the number of lines that you have to write.

## Steps to use this library:
Please refer to the [Quick Setup Guide](https://github.com/WrichikBasu/AudioFocusController/wiki/Quick-Setup-Guide) in the Wiki section of this repoitory.

## Demonstration app:

This repository comes bundled with an app that not only demonstrates how to use the library, but is also helpful in testing whether your app behaves correctly if it loses audio focus.
